Working Functionalities:
	
1) Ping, Wget, Traceroute(with shortest path) are all working as expected when all the links are up, and also if one
   of the links is down and again when the link is brought up.
2) Server to server ping also working as expected (even in case of link failure between vhost2 and vhost3).
3) The routing convergence takes 30-60 seconds. 


In a nutshell all the required functionalities are working as given in the project document.
